Typesetting Container OS documentation
======================================

This repository contains the code for the typesetting container of the journal "Philosophy and the Mind Sciences" (PhiMiSci). The typesetting container can be used to convert journal articles submitted in Markdown, which can be processed with Pandoc, into various formats. The container is currently configured to output the following formats:

1. PDF
2. HTML
3. JATS
4. TEX

The typesetting container was originally developed for the workflow of the journal `Philosophy and the Mind Sciences <https://philosophymindscience.org/>`__ The version provided here is an extension of this workflow and can also be used by other journals.

The container is configured to be run via Docker. It can be operated either through the command line interface or started as a web application. The typesetting container can be used directly with the supplied standard templates without any further configuration. However, you can also adjust or replace the standard templates with custom templates.
